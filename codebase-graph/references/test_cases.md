# 2. Validate the graph
python3 .opencode/skills/codebase-graph/scripts/codebase-graph.py validate

# 3. Check statistics
python3 .opencode/skills/codebase-graph/scripts/codebase-graph.py stats

# 4. Test queries
python3 .opencode/skills/codebase-graph/scripts/codebase-graph.py query --type Function --name "main"
python3 .opencode/skills/codebase-graph/scripts/codebase-graph.py deps --file "src/main.ts"

# 5. Check AGENTS.md integration
cat .codebase-graph/AGENTS.md.check

# 6. Review build log
cat .codebase-graph/build.log
```

When modifying the codebase-graph skill, run all test cases and verify:

- [ ] TC-001: Full rebuild still works

## Performance Benchmarks

| Codebase Size | Build Time | Graph Size | Query Time |
|---------------|------------|------------|------------|
| 50 files | <10s | <500KB | <1s |
| 200 files | <30s | <2MB | <1s |
| 500 files | <60s | <5MB | <2s |
| 1000+ files | <120s | <10MB | <2s |

**Note**: Build times may vary based on file complexity and language mix.
